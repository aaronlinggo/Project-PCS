@Genebi Use the ! (Not) operator.

!path/filename

@vishwasgupta you need to delete them all and then make a commit that deletes them.

kmorcinek commented on Apr 21, 2019
@Genebi you can also add one file explicit, like:
git add -f my/ignore/file.foo

Thanks a lot for the sharing ! GitHub should add your gitIgnore in ".gitignore template". They currently have nothing for C# projects ! :'(
